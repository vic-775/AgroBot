      "Importance\n",
      "NLB can occur in all maize growing areas of New Zealand but is most prevalent in the warmer wetter areas of the \n",
      "North Island, such as Waikato and northern Bay of Plenty. However, changing weather patterns may lead to impacts \n",
      "in a wider geographic area. Because of its widespread distribution and ability to spread rapidly under suitable \n",
      "weather conditions, NLB is considered the most serious foliar disease of maize in New Zealand.\n",
      "Losses due to NLB in New Zealand are variable, depending on both climate and hybrid resistance. Weather conditions \n",
      "conducive to severe outbreaks occur about every three to five seasons, although this could change according to \n",
      "weather patterns. Crop losses depend on the extent of leaf damage and the stage of crop growth, and are directly \n",
      "related to a loss of photosynthetic tissue. The later the disease appears, the lower the yield loss. Yield may be \n",
      "reduced by up to 50% if the disease is well established by silking. It has been calculated that for each one percentage \n",
      "increase in disease there is a loss of 20.15 kg for each tonne of yield. Extensive leaf-kill late in the season causes \n",
      "negligible yield losses, but can weaken stems and predispose plants to stalk rots. High levels of disease at the end \n",
      "of the growing season results in high levels of fungal inoculum overwintering in crop residues. Severe lodging is often \n",
      "a feature of blighted fields.\n",
      "Symptoms\n",
      "Pale green flecks on the leaves appear within 24 hours of infection. Lesions, which are typical of NLB, appear 10-14 \n",
      "days later. These lesions are typically elliptical (often described as canoe-shaped), measure up to 15 cm x 4 cm, and \n",
      "are grey-green, but later become light brown or tan in the centre with grey-green margins. Lesions normally begin on \n",
      "the lower leaves, spreading to the upper leaves. Under moist conditions, spores are produced on the dead tissue, \n",
      "giving the lesion a black tinge. The lesions continue to grow and join together, and up to 70% of the leaf area may die. \n",
